My portfolio includes an about me section that includes a bit of information about myself, a skills section showcasing the languages and frameworks I'm familiar with, the projects I've developed including Cloudflow, Quizzero, X, and the portfolio iteself, and finally a contact page with links to my email and Github page. The icons were imported via Font Awesome, and the animated, rotating boxes in the background of the site were made with HTML empty divs and CSS absolute positioning to position them randomly in the background and box-animate animations all timed differently. The site is fully responsive and mobile-friendly with a hamburger menu for the links.
